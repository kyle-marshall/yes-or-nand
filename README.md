# yes-or-nand

There's not much to this Logic World mod. I copied the AndGate to create an Or and Nand gate.

Yes, you can already make both of these in Logic World, but these could be preferable in some cases for size and lack of delay in the case of Nand.

I will re-copy-fu each time they update the base game as long as they don't add their own versions of these gates.

Since I could not get the x-menu to show up to change how many inputs the component has, I made added 3 variants of each gate into right into the menu.

Poke me on discord if there is an issue or I forget to update it!
